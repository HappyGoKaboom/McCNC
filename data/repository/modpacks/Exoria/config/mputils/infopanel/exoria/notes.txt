Welcome to Exoria!

1.) Press "Grave" to open your quest book (feel free to change in your Better Questing keybinds)

2.) In the rare case that no portal spawned at spawn upon world creation, make sure to create a new world.

3.) Travelling to a new dimension for the first time will create some lag, make sure to wait a bit until the chunks around you are generated. In Singleplayer you can lower the Render Distance to speed the process up.
